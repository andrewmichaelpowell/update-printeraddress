This PowerShell module allows system administrators to change the IP of a network printer configured on a remote computer. The remote computer must be reachable on the network and your account must have the appropriate permissions.  This is intended for situations where you have changed the IP address of a printer and need to update the configured port on each computer that uses it.  

Syntax: update-printeraddress `<oldipaddress>` `<newipaddress>`
